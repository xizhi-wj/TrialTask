This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This is a functional prototype project aimed at replicating the expected interaction process and visual language of the final website. The focus of this project is on smooth transitions, hover effects, scroll based animations, and overall accuracy of UI behavior.

## Project Dependencies

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework for server-rendered or statically-exported React applications.
- [React](https://reactjs.org) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - React library for animations.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
